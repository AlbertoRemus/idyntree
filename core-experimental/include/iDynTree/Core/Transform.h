     *
     * De Laet T, Bellens S, Smits R, AertbeliÃ«n E, Bruyninckx H, and De Schutter J
     * (2013), Geometric Relations between Rigid Bodies: Semantics for Standardization,
     * IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine, Vol. 20, No. 1, pp. 84-93.
     * URL : http://people.mech.kuleuven.be/~tdelaet/geometric_relations_semantics/geometric_relations_semantics_theory.pdf
     *
     * However this class is designed to be an easy to use proxy to perform change of frame of
     * expression for iDynTree::Position, iDynTree::Twist, iDynTree::Wrench. Hence with respect to
     * the PoseCoord we restrict the semantics to the one of the homogeneous transformation matrix
     * representation, enforcing that the reference orientation frame is always coincident with teh
     * coordinate frame . For this reason the class is called "Transform", because it will be mainly
     * used to transform quantities between frames.
     *
     * Given that this class it may used to represent homogeneous transform matrix as well as adjoint
     * matrix, no raw access to the underline storage ( data() method ) is provided, because it does not
     * have a canonical representation.
