kdl_codyco
==========

 Kinematics and Dynamics Library extensions developed in the CoDyCo project.
 
 This repositories contains several solvers for KDL developed and used by the CoDyCo project,
 but that can be of general interest. 
 
 The main features added are:
 * Support for floating base chain recursive Newton-Euler dynamics 
 * Support for explicit (and arbitrary) serialization of KDL::Tree joints and links (TreeSerialization)
 * Support for floating base tree recursive Newton-Euler dynamics
 * Support for tree center of mass computation
